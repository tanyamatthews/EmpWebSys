Welcome to Employee System, please stay tuned for more updates.
Database intialisation
----------------------

To initialise the database follow these steps:
- `cd` to `/databaseinit`
- './databaseinit.sh'
- Enter your MYSQL's root user's password

This will create a database called EmployeeSystems and user (`EmployeeUser` password: `password`)
with all privileges
